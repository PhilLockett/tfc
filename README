Installing from tarball
-----------------------

The install process described in the INSTALL document is a generic 
description of the install process. The install process is also described 
in the README.md document. For completeness the install process is also 
described below. All three descriptions are essentially the same and clearly, 
it only needs to be installed once.

The install you will need a C++ compiler and make installed to compile 
'tfc'' from a release tarball. You will also need the ImageMagick image 
processing suite installed. The following command will unpack the tarball.

$ tar zxf tfc-1.0.tar.gz

After unpacking, cd to the toplevel directory, tfc-1.0, and issue the 
following shell commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
